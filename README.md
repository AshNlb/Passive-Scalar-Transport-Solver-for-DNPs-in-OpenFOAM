# Passive-Scalar-Transport-Solver-for-DNPs-in-OpenFOAM
This OpenFOAM solver solves for the convection and difusion of delayed neutron precursors in liquid fuel.
Main application: Modeling of Molten Salt Reactors.  
An application case is provided together with the solver. The case is the standard buoyant cavity tutorial available in OpenFOAM. It is filled with liquid molten salt fuel with an internal heat source correspondin to 1 GW total power level. A lid velocity of 0.5m/s is considered. The example shows the distribution of DNP groups after being transported with the flow. 
See the AppC.pdf file for more info on the solver.
